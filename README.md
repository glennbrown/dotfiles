My configuration, try to keep it simple it depends on:

* [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
* [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
* [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

I use MacOS as my daily driver so they are geared towards that, but should be adaptable to any Linux/BSD distro with zsh. I also for legacy purposes have my older bash config installed.
